      "description": "I'm an R&D specialist turned tech enthusiast, driven by a passion for problem-solving and a curiosity that keeps me seeking new challenges. My background in R&D has honed my analytical thinking, creativity, and effective communication skills, which I now bring to the world of technology.\n\nI have a natural aptitude for organizing and a keen interest in leveraging technology to optimize systems, which led me to make a pivotal decision in my career. Recognizing the importance of merging my managerial skills with my passion for technology, I took a bold step to quit my job and pursue software development at 42 School.\n\nHere, I've confirmed my passion for technology and discovered the critical role of team management in technological environments. I am now eager to blend my technical expertise with my managerial skills in a full-time hybrid or remote position with an international focus, where I can make a  human and/or ecological impact with my work.",
