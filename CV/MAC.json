      "description": "If you are seeking someone driven by a passion for problem-solving and a curiosity for tackling new challenges, I would be thrilled to join your team. With a background in developing R&D projects, I have refined my analytical thinking, creativity, and effective communication skills, which I now bring to the realm of technology. A natural aptitude for organizing and a keen interest in leveraging technology to optimize systems drove me to make a pivotal decision in my career—to leave my previous job and pursue software development studies. Through this journey, I aimed to discover and improve my role in team management within technological environments.\n\nI am now enthusiastic about blending my technical expertise with my managerial skills in a full-time hybrid or remote position with an international focus. I am eager to make a positive impact through my work.",
